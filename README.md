# OCI_Trial_Iris_Predictor
This is a simple machine learning project that predicts the type of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on four features:

* Sepal length

* Sepal width

* Petal length

* Petal width

Features

Uses the classic Iris dataset (built-in with scikit-learn).

Trains a simple ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or KNN).

Takes input values and predicts the Iris species.
